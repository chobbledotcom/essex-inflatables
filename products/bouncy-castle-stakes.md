## Stakes for Securing Inflatable Equipment

We supply both new and used stakes for securing inflatable play equipment. Stakes are essential safety equipment that must be properly maintained and replaced when showing signs of wear or damage.

### Pricing Information

Stake prices fluctuate based on current steel costs at the time of purchase. We provide quotes based on current market prices when you enquire. Both individual stakes and bulk orders are available, with discounts possible for larger quantities.

### Availability

Stock levels vary as stakes are popular items amongst operators. We maintain supplies of standard stake sizes and can source specific requirements if needed. Please contact us to check current availability and pricing.
