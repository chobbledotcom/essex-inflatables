## Spare Parts and Equipment for Operators

We maintain stocks of essential spare parts and equipment to keep your inflatable business operational. From replacement fans to repair materials, we supply the components operators need for maintenance and emergency repairs.

### Fans and Blowers

We offer both new and reconditioned fans and blowers suitable for various inflatable sizes. Our selection includes different power ratings to match your specific equipment requirements. All electrical equipment can be PAT tested for safety compliance.

We also provide fan repair services and cleaning services to extend the life of your existing equipment. Regular maintenance of blowers ensures consistent performance and reduces the risk of unexpected failures during operation.
