## HSE Best Practices for Inflatable Play Equipment

### Understanding Safety Requirements

The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) sets clear expectations for operators of inflatable play equipment. Under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (HASAWA) and the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (PUWER), operators must ensure their equipment is safe for public use. Regular inspection and maintenance are not just best practice but legal requirements that protect both operators and users.

Essex Inflatables has been conducting safety inspections since 1997 under HSE recommendations for best practice. We became a certified PIPA Inspection Body in 2004, providing operators with the assurance that their equipment meets all necessary safety standards.

### PIPA Testing and BS EN 14960 Standards

PIPA (Performance Inflatable Play Accreditation) is the HSE-endorsed inspection scheme for inflatable play equipment. The scheme follows BS EN 14960, the European standard that governs the safety requirements and test methods for inflatable play equipment. This comprehensive standard covers all aspects of inflatable safety from design and manufacture through to operation and maintenance.

Our PIPA inspections examine structural integrity, ensuring frames and supports are secure and free from defects. We inspect seams and fabric condition, checking for wear, tears, and potential failure points that could compromise safety. Air retention is tested to verify inflatables maintain appropriate pressure for safe operation. Anchor points are examined for security and wear, as these are critical safety features. Electrical systems, including blowers and connections, are checked for safety and proper operation.

### The Importance of Annual Testing

Annual testing is an annual inspection scheme for health and safety endorsed by the HSE. Regular inspections identify developing issues before they become safety hazards, protecting operators from potential liability and ensuring continued safe operation. Whilst PIPA testing is not legally mandatory, HSE guidance clearly states that operators using accredited schemes like PIPA or ADIPS demonstrate compliance with best practices.

Operators who choose not to use accredited testing schemes must be able to prove the competence of their testing personnel if required by enforcement authorities. This places significant burden on operators to demonstrate their testing meets equivalent standards to accredited schemes.

### Our Testing Credentials

All our testers are certified under the PIPA scheme and maintain current training on safety standards and regulations. We have the necessary equipment to conduct thorough inspections according to BS EN 14960 requirements. Our team follows strict safety protocols during all inspections and maintains comprehensive insurance coverage for professional testing services.

We also hold PAT test certification, allowing us to test electrical equipment such as blowers during inspections. This comprehensive approach ensures all aspects of your inflatable equipment meet safety requirements.

### Maintenance Between Inspections

Annual testing forms the foundation of safety compliance, but operators must maintain equipment between inspections. Regular visual checks should identify obvious damage or wear before each use. Cleaning and proper storage extend equipment life and maintain safety standards. Minor repairs should be addressed promptly to prevent deterioration.

Our repair facility provides professional maintenance services to keep equipment in optimal condition between annual inspections. We handle everything from minor patches to major structural repairs, using professional materials and equipment to ensure lasting repairs.

### Legal Compliance and Insurance

Using a certified PIPA testing service provides documented compliance with HSE best practices. This documentation is essential for insurance purposes and demonstrates due diligence in equipment maintenance. Many insurance policies require annual testing by accredited schemes as a condition of coverage.

In the event of an incident, having current PIPA certification and maintenance records provides crucial evidence of proper equipment care. This documentation can be the difference between a successful insurance claim and potential legal liability.

### Booking Your Safety Inspection

Schedule your annual PIPA inspection well before certificate expiry to ensure continuous compliance. Contact us with details of your equipment, location, and preferred inspection dates. We provide written quotes for all inspection services and work around your operational schedule to minimise disruption.

For operators new to PIPA testing, we can explain the process and requirements in detail. Our team guides you through the inspection process and helps you understand how to maintain compliance throughout the year.
