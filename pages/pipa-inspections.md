## PIPA Testing and Safety Inspection Services

Essex Inflatables has been a certified PIPA Inspection Body since 2004, providing comprehensive annual inspection services for inflatable play equipment throughout Essex and the Southeast. PIPA (Performance Inflatable Play Accreditation) is the HSE-endorsed inspection scheme that ensures inflatable play equipment meets essential health and safety standards.

### What is PIPA Testing?

PIPA is an annual inspection scheme for health and safety endorsed by the HSE (Health and Safety Executive). The scheme ensures that inflatable play equipment is regularly inspected, properly maintained, and safe for public use. Our inspections follow the EU standard BS EN 14960, which sets out the safety requirements and test methods for inflatable play equipment.

All operators of inflatable play equipment used for commercial purposes require annual PIPA inspections to comply with health and safety regulations. Regular inspections help identify potential issues before they become safety hazards, ensuring the continued safe operation of your equipment and protecting both operators and users.

### Our Inspection Process

Our certified PIPA inspectors conduct thorough examinations of all aspects of your inflatable equipment. The inspection covers structural integrity, seam strength, anchor points, and overall condition. We check for wear and tear, damage, and any modifications that might affect safety. Each piece of equipment is tested according to strict protocols to ensure it meets all required standards.

Following the inspection, we provide detailed documentation including your PIPA certificate, inspection report, and any recommendations for maintenance or repairs. If issues are identified during inspection, we can provide quotes for necessary repairs at our facility, ensuring your equipment returns to full compliance quickly.

### Equipment We Inspect

Our PIPA inspection service covers all continuous flow land inflatables including:

- Bouncy castles of all sizes and designs
- Assault courses and obstacle runs
- Slides including combination units
- Disco domes and party inflatables
- Flat play beds and soft play areas
- Enclosed units and themed castles
- Multi-play combination equipment
- Other continuous flow inflatables

We also provide annual safety inspections for equipment that falls outside PIPA's remit, including pole joust, pool inflatables, barfly units, gladiator duels, human table football, and other specialised inflatable equipment.

### Inspection Scheduling and Coverage

We travel to operator locations throughout Essex, London, Kent, Hertfordshire, Surrey, and the broader Southeast region. Our inspection team can visit council facilities, schools, storage facilities, and operator premises. We understand that access requirements vary, and we accommodate out-of-hours inspections for venues that require them.

Call-out charges apply based on location and timing requirements. Standard hours inspections are available at our standard call-out rate, whilst venues requiring evening or weekend access may incur additional charges. We work with operators to schedule inspections at convenient times that minimise disruption to their business operations.

### Our Inspection Team

Our inspection team consists of certified PIPA inspectors with extensive experience in inflatable equipment safety. We currently have one qualified PIPA inspector on our team, with plans to expand to two or three inspectors to meet growing demand and reduce waiting times for inspections.

All our inspectors are certified under the PIPA scheme and regularly update their training to stay current with safety standards and regulations. We maintain comprehensive insurance coverage and follow all safety protocols during inspections. Our team also holds PAT test certification, allowing us to test electrical equipment such as blowers during inspections.

### Booking Your PIPA Inspection

To book your annual PIPA inspection, contact us by phone or email with details of your equipment and preferred inspection dates. We recommend booking well in advance of your certificate expiry to ensure availability and avoid any gaps in certification.

For quotes and scheduling, please provide information about the number and types of inflatables requiring inspection, your location, and any specific access requirements. We provide written quotes via email for all inspection services, ensuring clear pricing and service expectations.
