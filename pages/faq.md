## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does a repair cost?

Repair costs vary depending on several factors including the size of your inflatable, the extent of damage, and the complexity of the repair required. We provide quotes on a case-by-case basis after assessing the specific requirements. To get an accurate quote, we ask that you send photographs of the damage along with information about the inflatable's size and manufacturer. For a detailed assessment, we offer a pre-examination service for £30, where we thoroughly inspect your equipment and provide a comprehensive written quote.

Different types of repairs carry different costs. Simple patches might be relatively inexpensive, whilst panel replacements or internal structural repairs require more time and materials. Some manufacturer designs are more accessible than others, which can affect labour time. We always aim to provide transparent, fair pricing based on the actual work required.

### How often do I need my equipment PIPA tested?

PIPA testing is required annually for all commercial inflatable play equipment. Your PIPA certificate is valid for one year from the date of inspection, and you should arrange your next inspection before the certificate expires to maintain continuous compliance. We recommend booking your annual inspection well in advance of the expiry date to ensure availability and avoid any gaps in certification.

Some operators choose to have inspections done during quieter winter months when their equipment is not in regular use. This timing allows for any necessary repairs to be completed before the busy season begins. Regular annual inspections help identify developing issues early, potentially saving money on major repairs later.

### What is included in a PIPA inspection?

A PIPA inspection is a comprehensive safety assessment of your inflatable equipment. Our certified inspector examines all aspects of the inflatable including structural integrity, seam strength, material condition, and anchor points. We check for signs of wear, damage, or modifications that might affect safety. The inspection follows strict protocols set out in the BS EN 14960 standard.

Following the inspection, you receive a PIPA certificate if your equipment passes, along with a detailed inspection report. If any issues are identified, we provide information about required repairs or maintenance. We can also provide quotes for any necessary repair work, which can be completed at our facility. The inspection includes testing of the inflatable itself, though electrical equipment like blowers may require separate PAT testing.

### Do you travel outside of Essex?

Yes, we serve a wide area beyond Essex. Our service coverage includes London, Kent, Hertfordshire, Surrey, and the broader Southeast region. For PIPA inspections, we travel to operator locations, council facilities, schools, and storage sites throughout these areas. Travel charges apply based on distance and time requirements, with quotes provided when you book our services.

For repairs, equipment must be brought to our facility in the Hullbridge area, as we do not currently offer mobile on-site repairs. This ensures we have access to all necessary equipment and materials to complete repairs to the highest standard. We can discuss collection options for larger items or multiple pieces of equipment.

### Can you repair my inflatable on-site?

Currently, all repairs must be completed at our dedicated facility in Hullbridge. We do not offer mobile on-site repairs at this time. This in-house approach ensures we have access to our professional equipment, including air-cooled twin needle sewing machines, comprehensive material stocks, and proper working conditions necessary for quality repairs.

We understand this means operators need to transport their equipment to us, but this approach ensures the best possible repair quality. Our controlled workshop environment allows us to complete complex repairs that would be impossible or impractical to attempt on-site. Mobile repair services are something we are considering for future years.

### What if I need an emergency repair?

We offer emergency call-out services for urgent repair situations. However, even for emergency repairs, equipment must be brought to our facility. Emergency services help prioritise urgent repairs to minimise your downtime during peak operating periods. Call-out charges for emergency services vary depending on timing and location.

Standard business hours emergency calls are charged at our regular call-out rate. Out-of-hours emergency services, including evenings and weekends, incur additional charges. When you contact us for emergency repair, we provide clear pricing information and estimated turnaround times based on the urgency and complexity of the repair.

### Do you sell parts and equipment?

We maintain stocks of essential spare parts and equipment for operators. This includes replacement fans and blowers, both new and reconditioned units. We stock repair materials including patches, glue, and thread for operators who handle minor repairs themselves. Stakes for securing inflatables are available, with pricing dependent on current steel costs.

Second-hand equipment becomes available occasionally through our connections with Ellis Leisure (www.ellisleisure.co.uk) and other operators. When quality used equipment is available, we can facilitate sales between operators. We do not manufacture new inflatables ourselves, though this is something we are exploring for the future along with import and export opportunities.

### How do I book a PIPA inspection?

Contact us by phone on 01268 569302 or email enquiries@essexinflatables.co.uk with details of your equipment and preferred inspection dates. We need to know the number and types of inflatables requiring inspection, your location, and any specific access requirements. We recommend booking well in advance of your certificate expiry date.

We provide written quotes via email for all inspection services, which is our preferred method for maintaining clear records. Once you approve the quote, we schedule your inspection at a mutually convenient time. For venues with specific access requirements, such as schools that need after-hours inspection, we arrange appropriate timing.

### What areas do you cover for different services?

For PIPA inspections, we travel throughout Essex, London, Kent, Hertfordshire, Surrey, and the Southeast region. We visit operator premises, council facilities, schools, and storage locations. Travel charges apply based on distance and timing requirements.

For repairs, equipment must come to our Hullbridge facility. We serve the same geographical area, but operators are responsible for delivering equipment to us or arranging collection. This ensures all repairs benefit from our professional workshop facilities and equipment.

### How long do repairs typically take?

Repair timeframes vary depending on the complexity of work required and our current workload. Simple repairs like small patches might be completed within a day or two, whilst complex structural repairs or multiple panel replacements may take longer. We provide estimated timeframes when quoting for repairs.

During busy periods, particularly early in the season, turnaround times may be extended. We keep operators informed about progress and can provide updates on request. For emergency repairs, we prioritise work to minimise downtime, though this may incur additional charges.
