## Professional Testing and Repair Facility for Inflatable Play Equipment

Essex Inflatables is a specialist testing and repair facility serving operators of inflatable play equipment throughout Essex and the Southeast. We provide the essential behind-the-scenes services that operators need to keep their equipment safe, compliant and operational. Our facility has been repairing inflatable equipment since 1994 and conducting safety inspections since 1997.

Unlike hire companies, we work exclusively with operators and businesses to maintain their inflatable equipment. Our comprehensive services include annual PIPA inspections for health and safety compliance, professional repairs for all types of damage, and supply of replacement parts and equipment.

### Safety Inspections

We became a PIPA Inspection Body in 2004 and provide HSE-endorsed inspection services using the EU standard BS EN 14960. Our certified inspectors conduct thorough annual inspections to ensure your equipment meets all health and safety requirements. We currently have one PIPA inspector on our team, soon expanding to two or three inspectors to meet growing demand.

### Professional Repairs

Our in-house repair facility handles all types of inflatable damage and maintenance requirements. From bed stitches and panel replacements to complete structural repairs, we use professional-grade equipment including air-cooled twin needle sewing machines and the highest quality PVC materials and thread. All repairs are completed at our dedicated facility in the Holbridge area, ensuring consistent quality and proper workspace for even the most complex repairs.

### Operator Support Services

We understand the unique needs of inflatable operators and provide comprehensive support including emergency call-out services, pre-examination checks for equipment assessment, and supply of essential parts and second-hand equipment when available. Our team provides expert advice based on decades of experience in the industry.
