## Professional Inflatable Repair Services

Essex Inflatables has been repairing inflatable play equipment since 1994, providing operators with reliable, high-quality repair services from our dedicated facility. Our experienced team handles everything from minor patches to complete structural rebuilds, using professional-grade equipment and materials to ensure lasting repairs.

### Our Repair Facility

All repairs are completed at our dedicated workshop facility in the Holbridge area. This in-house approach ensures consistent quality control, proper working conditions, and access to all necessary equipment and materials. We do not currently offer mobile on-site repairs, as our facility provides the controlled environment necessary for professional-quality work.

Our workshop is equipped with air-cooled twin needle sewing machines specifically designed for heavy-duty PVC work. We maintain extensive stocks of high-quality PVC materials in various colours and weights, along with professional-grade thread that ensures strong, durable repairs. This investment in proper equipment and materials means we can handle repairs that others might consider beyond salvage.

### Types of Repairs We Undertake

Our repair services cover all aspects of inflatable maintenance and damage repair. We specialise in bed stitches, which are critical for the structural integrity of bouncy castles. Back panel stitches are another common repair we handle, ensuring the walls and structures of inflatables remain secure and safe.

Panel replacement is a significant part of our work. Whether it is a torn base sheet, damaged wall panel, or worn bed section, we can fabricate and install replacement panels that match the original specifications. We recently completed a full section panel replacement on the base of a jungle assault course, where the operators had torn the base sheet whilst loading it into their van.

We repair rips and tears of all sizes, from small punctures to major structural damage. Our technicians assess each tear to determine the best repair method, whether that is patching, stitching, or panel replacement. Anchor points, which bear significant stress during use, are frequently replaced or reinforced to ensure continued safe operation.

Internal repairs form a specialised part of our services. We install new zips in step-on stools, replace bed panels inside castle structures, and repair diaphragms within the internal framework. These repairs often require careful disassembly and reassembly, work that benefits from our controlled workshop environment.

### Our Repair Process

When equipment arrives at our facility, we conduct a thorough assessment to identify all issues requiring attention. We examine not just the reported damage but check the entire inflatable for any additional problems that might affect safety or longevity. This comprehensive approach helps operators avoid unexpected failures and extends equipment life.

Following assessment, we provide a detailed quote based on the size of the inflatable, extent of damage, and complexity of required repairs. Different manufacturer designs require different approaches, as some castles provide easier internal access than others. Chinese-manufactured units, for example, often require different techniques than European-made equipment.

Once repairs are approved, our technicians work systematically through each issue, ensuring all work meets our quality standards. We use matching materials wherever possible and ensure all repairs are both functional and aesthetically acceptable. After completion, we conduct final checks to ensure the inflatable is ready for safe operation.

### Pre-Examination Service

For operators unsure about repair requirements or costs, we offer a pre-examination service for Â£25. This service includes a thorough inspection of your equipment, identification of all issues requiring attention, and a detailed written quote for necessary repairs. This allows operators to make informed decisions about repair versus replacement and budget accordingly for maintenance costs.

During pre-examination, we can discuss repair options with operators, explaining what work is essential for safety compliance versus what might be cosmetic or optional. This consultation helps operators prioritise repairs according to their budget and operational needs.

### Emergency Repair Services

We understand that damaged equipment means lost revenue for operators. We offer emergency call-out services for urgent situations, though equipment must still be brought to our facility for repair. Our emergency service helps operators get critical repairs completed quickly, minimising downtime during peak operating seasons.

Call-out charges vary depending on location, time of day, and urgency. Standard business hours call-outs are charged at our regular rate, whilst out-of-hours emergency services incur additional charges. We provide clear pricing for emergency services when operators contact us, ensuring no surprises.

### Blower and Fan Maintenance

Beyond inflatable repairs, we service and maintain the blowers and fans essential for operating inflatable equipment. Our services include complete strip-down and cleaning of fan units, replacement of worn components, and testing to ensure optimal performance. We also provide PAT testing for electrical safety compliance.

Regular blower maintenance extends equipment life and ensures consistent inflation pressure. We stock common replacement parts and can source components for most blower models. When repair is not economical, we can advise on suitable replacement options from our selection of new and reconditioned units.

### Getting Your Equipment Repaired

To arrange repairs, contact us with details of the damage and, if possible, photographs showing the affected areas. This helps us provide initial estimates and advise on whether the repair is economically viable. We can then arrange for you to deliver the equipment to our facility or discuss collection options for larger items.

We aim to complete most repairs within a reasonable timeframe, though complex jobs or busy periods may extend turnaround times. We keep operators informed throughout the repair process and can provide updates on progress as needed.
