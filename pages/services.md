## Comprehensive Testing and Repair Services for Inflatable Equipment

Essex Inflatables provides essential maintenance and compliance services for operators of inflatable play equipment. Our in-house facility handles everything from minor repairs to complete structural rebuilds, alongside certified safety inspections that keep your equipment compliant and operational.

### Professional Repair Services

Our repair facility handles all types of inflatable damage using professional-grade equipment and materials. We specialise in bed stitches, back panel stitches, and complete panel replacements. Our experienced technicians repair rips and tears of all sizes, replace damaged anchor points, and install new zips in stools. We also undertake complex internal repairs including bed panel replacements and diaphragm repairs inside the castle structure.

All repairs are completed at our dedicated facility using air-cooled twin needle sewing machines and the highest quality PVC materials and thread. We work with various manufacturer designs, understanding that each requires different approaches and techniques. Our quote-based pricing system ensures transparency, with assessments based on the size of the inflatable, extent of damage, and complexity of the repair required.

### PIPA Testing and Safety Inspections

As a certified PIPA Inspection Body since 2004, we provide annual inspections required for health and safety compliance under HSE guidelines. Our inspections follow the EU standard BS EN 14960 and cover all continuous flow land inflatables. We also conduct safety inspections for inflatables that fall outside PIPA's remit, ensuring all your equipment meets safety standards.

Equipment requiring PIPA tests includes bouncy castles, assault courses, slides, disco domes, flat play beds, enclosed units, and multi-play equipment. We also provide annual testing for non-PIPA equipment such as pole joust, pool inflatables, barfly, gladiators, and table football inflatables.

### Additional Services

We offer emergency call-out services for urgent repair needs, though all repairs must be brought to our facility as we do not currently provide mobile on-site repairs. Our pre-examination service allows operators to have equipment assessed for a Â£25 service charge, providing a detailed inspection and quote before committing to repairs.

We also maintain and repair blowers and fans, offering both repair services and cleaning services to keep your equipment running efficiently. When available, we supply second-hand equipment and essential parts including spare fans, extra cones, repair kits, and stakes.

### Service Coverage Area

We serve operators throughout Essex, London, Kent, Hertfordshire, Surrey, and the broader Southeast region. For PIPA inspections, we travel to council facilities, schools, and operator locations, with call-out charges varying based on location and timing requirements. Some venues require out-of-hours access, which we accommodate with adjusted pricing.
